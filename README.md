If you'd like to see everything already running, here's the [link](https://lemon-energia-button-design.vercel.app/).

Without further ado, let me guide you through the first steps of running this application.

## Install dependencies

The project has some basic depedencies, but dependencies nonetheless; so let's start by installing them.

### `npm install`

## Run project

In order to run the program locally, just use the following code. Simplicity is elegant, right?

### `npm start`

## Test features

How about testing everything? Well, I've prepared some automatic tests so we can assure some important things are running smoothly without the need to check manually!

### `npm test`

## That's it!

Thank you for your time. Hope you like what you see and until the next time!
